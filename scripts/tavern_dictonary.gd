There are many hundreds of different races, inhabiting anything from forests to deserts to plains, and everything else in-between. They are an incredibly common sight in nearly every city, and most others welcome them as friends and allies.[p]This commonality of course also means that humanity is one of the greatest villains of the world, and just as they are welcomed in some places they are absolutely despised in others. All in all Humans are one of the most varying Species, and more often than not everyone will have a different opinion depending on where a particular Human comes from.[p]Humans gain +1 to dexterity, constituion and charisma.",

For many people, Dwarves are a familiar sight, and it is not uncommon to stumble upon a Dwarven hold in any given corner of Arethil.

They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.[p]Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so.

Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.[p]Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they’re just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors.

That said, many halflings possess a brave and adventurous spirit that leads them on journeys of discovery, affording them the chance to explore a bigger world and make new friends along the way. Their size—similar to that of a human child—helps them pass through crowds unnoticed and slip through tight spaces.[p]Anyone who has spent time around halflings, particularly halfling adventurers, has likely witnessed the storied 'luck of the halflings' in action. When a halfling is in mortal danger, an unseen force seems to intervene on the halfling’s behalf.

Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.[p]To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile.

Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children's children will always be held accountable.[p]Tieflings gain +1 to dexterity and wisdom scores and the Bloodline trait.

They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don’t have to.

Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.[p]Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.[p]Clerics gain a +1 bonus to wisdom and the Turn Undead trait.

And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and defying it.[p]Fighters master various weapon techniques, and a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool at hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is adept with every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic.

Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.[p]Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.[p]Monks gain + 1 dexterity and the Flurry of Blows trait.

It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.[p]Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world’s armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin.

A few even learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.[p]Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while others used their cunning to fight crime. Whatever a Rogue’s relation to the law, no common criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle brilliance of the greatest Rogues.[p] Rogues gain +1 to dexterity and Sneak Attack trait.

In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.[p]Once a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study.

Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.[p]But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.[p]Wizards gain +1 to wisdom and the scholar trait.

They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections.[p]Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.[p]Artificers gain +1 to wisdom and the Magical Tinkering trait.

Some of these rangers pursue this path for the thrill of discovering something beautiful or unique while others do it to increase their wealth. Whatever the reason that prompts these rangers to accumulate valuables, a treasure hunter’s dream is to discover a dragon’s hoard because no other single location offers the variety of extraordinary items.[p]Raiding a dragon’s den is no small feat even if the dragon isn’t present. Many dragons booby trap their lair or disguise it with illusion magic and secret entrances. A treasure hunter’s training focuses on stealth to avoid alerting anyone of their presence, observation to discover secret hiding places, and mobility to get into places that are typically difficult to access. They also learn to disarm traps and to battle large (and angry) creatures that have already laid claim to treasure hoards.[p]Treasure Hunters gain +1 dexterity and the Looter trait.

In joining an order of blood hunters, one also joins a family bound by service to each other and a common cause. For many, this might be the only family they have left—or have ever known—making the kinship felt between blood hunters an all-but-unbreakable bond.[p]Outside the camaraderie of their orders, however, the life of a blood hunter is not an easy one. The ritual of the Hunter’s Bane can leave a character visibly changed, and prone to unsettling the people around them. Likewise, witnessing hemocraft can invoke superstitious fears from even the most learned scholars. While some cultures have come to accept the good deeds of many blood hunter orders, many blood hunters hide their calling unless absolutely necessary. They feel more comfortable in the wilds and wastes of the world, or drift through the outskirts of society, protecting the poor and defenseless from dark intention and the corrupting touch of fiends.[p] Blood Hunters gain +1 wisdom and the Grim Psychometry trait.
